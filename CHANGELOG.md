[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-22

Fixes surfaced by a large test-suite expansion (RFC reads + cross-checking
against httpx, curl, and h2spec).

### Performance

- **TCP_NODELAY**: every small response previously incurred a ~40 ms
  Nagle/delayed-ACK stall. Disabling Nagle takes small-file throughput from
  ~390 to ~41,600 req/s (p50 41 ms → 0.28 ms) and listings from ~380 to
  ~14,100 req/s on loopback. The sendfile large-file path was already ~2.5 GB/s.

### Fixed

- Upload: RFC 5987/8187 `filename*` (non-ASCII filenames) was silently dropped;
  now decoded (charset-validated) and preferred over plain `filename`.
- Upload: a plain non-ASCII `filename="naïve.txt"` was mojibake'd — part headers
  are decoded as UTF-8 (RFC 7578 §5.1.1).
- Upload: a zero-part body (just the close-delimiter) is accepted as empty.

### Added (tests)

- HTTP/1.1 conformance (methods, 9 path-traversal vectors, conditional
  precedence, MIME, HEAD==GET, multi-range, empty file) + httpx interop.
- Upload robustness (filename*, multiple files, boundary-in-content, chunked
  rejection) + httpx multipart interop.
- HTTP/2 conformance (h2spec generic 50/52 + hpack 8/8 validated; padded
  HEADERS, HPACK continuity, concurrent streams, malformed-request RST) + httpx
  h2-over-TLS interop.
- Security regression + abuse cases (URI/header limits, Slowloris timeout, CRLF
  injection e2e, upload containment, auth bypass).
- Performance/load smoke (Nagle regression guard, concurrent-correctness under
  free-threading, large-file integrity) + a runnable `scripts/bench.py`.

281 tests total.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-21

First stable release. A zero-dependency, pure-Python HTTP file server.

### Added

- **HTTP/1.1 file serving** (pure stdlib): rich, sortable (`?C=&O=`), searchable
  (`?q=`) directory listings with sizes and modified times; index documents.
- **RFC 9110 downloads**: `Range`/`206`/`416`, strong `ETag`s, the conditional
  ladder (`If-None-Match`/`If-Modified-Since`/`If-Range` → `304`/`412`), and
  zero-copy `socket.sendfile()` with a userspace fallback.
- **TLS/HTTPS** via `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key`, ALPN, HSTS over TLS, `--tls-help`.
- **HTTP Basic Auth** (`--auth`): single credential or pre-hashed
  `user:sha256:…`/`sha512`, constant-time comparison, no-TLS warning.
- **Upload** (`--upload`): streaming `multipart/form-data` parser (no `cgi`),
  atomic `os.replace`, bounded size (`--max-upload-size`), `--allow-overwrite`.
- **Archive download**: stream any directory as `tar.gz`/`zip` (`?archive=`),
  chunked, `Content-Disposition` with `filename*`, symlink-safe.
- **CORS** (`--cors` + preflight), **SPA fallback** (`--spa`), **cache control**
  (`--cache`), and secure headers (`nosniff` everywhere, scoped CSP +
  Referrer-Policy on generated pages; `--no-security-headers`).
- **Hardening**: `logging`-module access logs, default socket timeout
  (`--timeout`), optional bounded concurrency (`--max-workers`).
- **HTTP/2** (`--http2`): a pure-stdlib HTTP/2 server — HPACK (RFC 7541) and the
  frame codec (RFC 9113) implemented from the RFCs, ALPN `h2` + h2c, per-stream
  flow control, and DoS limits (concurrent-stream cap, header-block cap, RST
  budget). Verified against `curl --http2`.
- **HTTP/3** via the optional `servery[http3]` (aioquic) extra; the core stays
  zero-dependency. `servery._oscrypto` provides AES-256-GCM via `ctypes` → OS
  OpenSSL (NIST-vector verified) as the zero-PyPI-dependency crypto foundation.
- **Safe defaults**: localhost bind, path-traversal + symlink-escape containment
  (`realpath` + `commonpath`), exposure/cleartext-auth warnings.
- **Free-threading** support (3.13t/3.14t), full type hints (`ty`-checked), and a
  CI gate that enforces zero runtime dependencies in the core wheel.
